"Welcome to the Aberration Containment Foundation!

You have been assigned to the Aberrant Subjects Containment department. Your job will involve monitoring animate, potentially-sentient Aberrations and ensuring that they remain contained within their facilities.

On each shift you will be assigned a number of Aberrant Subjects to monitor. Each Subject has specific qualities that makes it difficult to contain. That’s where you come in. From the comfort of your workstation you will be able to ensure the containment of all your assigned Subjects.

A detailed description of each Aberration Subject can be found on the later pages of this handbook. Please review it at your convenience. When you are ready to begin your shift, punch in at your workstation. Good luck!

Note: Your job is to CONTAIN your assigned Aberrant Subjects, not to terminate them. The containment procedures for some of your assigned Subjects may pose a lethal hazard to the Subjects themselves. In addition to ensuring these Subjects’ containment, it is your duty to ensure their continued survival.","Description
ACF-HIL, more commonly known as the Homocidal, Indestructable Lizard, is a reptilian-looking quadroped similar in size and shape to an aligator.

ACF-HIL has demonstrated the following Aberrant qualities:
1) ACF-HIL is capable of speaking and understanding at least 4 spoken human languages, including English.
2) ACF-HIL is capable of steadily regenerating destroyed parts of its body.
3) ACF-HIL is capable of feats of strength previously thought impossible from a creature of its size. To date, purely physical restraints (eg. chains, concrete floors, steel doors, etc.) have proven to be insufficient for containing ACF-HIL.

Containment Procedures
ACF-HIL is to be periodically submerged in a vat of 82% hydrochloric acid. This process ensures that ACF-HIL remains too physically damaged to mount an escape attempt.
The period of being submerged must be timed to meet the following two criteria:
1) ACF-HIL must not remain outside of the acid bath for long enough to regenerate sufficient bodymass to escape its containment facility and kill all local human life.
2) ACF-HIL must not remain within the acid bath for long enough to terminate ACF-HIL.

Module Instructions
Your workstation module for monitoring ACF-HIL features a button which, upon activation will take ACF-HIL in and out of the acid bath.
Additionally, your workstation module features an indicator label which will inform you if ACF-HIL becomes dangerously close to either escape or termination.",Bongo!
