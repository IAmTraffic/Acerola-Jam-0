Theme - Aberration
A literal intepretation of this theme involves the abnormal outcome of something measurable, such as
chromatic aberration (a defective lens causing abnormal refraction), or perhaps an unexpected change in the flow of time,
a temporal aberration. The abstract intepretations of this theme are endless of course and I don't think it's possible to take it too far.
You could also capture the sinister undertones of this word's definition as a certain piece of media I like describes supernatural
beings as aberrations (unwelcome entities you wouldn't expect to exist). This theme is all about defying expectations literally
and abstractly, as well as getting really pretentious.

Side note: If your idea is chromatic aberration, you probably aren't going to win unless you're insanely goated.







Ideas:
	You are a bug trying to break someone's code
	A super abstract puzzle game where you have inputs that have unpredictable outcomes
	A platformer where you randomly lose control of your character
	You are an alien creature (an aberration) killing people on a space station
	A pony-island-esque game (bad idea)
	You are presented with patterns and have to identify the aberration among them
	You are asked a series of questions and you want your answers to be as far removed from the normal person's answers as possible
	You are a secret zombie and have to infect an arctic outpost without being caught
	A rage game where you think you know how to beat a level but it keeps changing the rules on you to prevent you from doing so
	You are a portal-esque lab rat and the testers keep changing the reward function on you
	You are presented with a long series of yes/no questions and you have to figure out what the rule is that determines which questions should be answered in which ways
	A tower defense game where the towers differ from their descriptions in random ways
	An exploration game where your map is not accurate
	A puzzle game where the rules change every time that you "beat" a level, in a way that prevents you from beating the level, so you have to figure out all the rules before you can actually win
	A platformer where a childish god changes the rules of the game to keep you from winning
	A platformer where the entire level is invisible, but your dead body leaves blood splatter that reveals some of the level
	You are an SCP-esque field agent capturing aberrations, or a desk-worker cataloguing or monitoring or maintaning the containment of aberrations
	You're in a remote research station and you have to figure out who the secret zombie is before it kills you

Better Ideas:
	You are the aberration
		You are an alien creature (an aberration) killing people on a space station
	You must identify the aberration
		A series of puzzles where you have to identify the rules to win in each puzzle before moving on
		You are presented with patterns and have to identify the aberration among them
		A platformer where a childish god changes the rules of the game to keep you from winning
		A puzzle game where the rules change every time that you "beat" a level, in a way that prevents you from beating the level, so you have to figure out all the rules before you can actually win
	You have to manage the aberration's weirdness
		You are an SCP-esque field agent capturing aberrations, or a desk-worker cataloguing or monitoring or maintaning the containment of aberrations

The Winning Idea:
	You are an SCP-esque desk jockey who has to monitor the containment of several aberrations, FNaF-style
